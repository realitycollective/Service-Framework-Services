# Reality Toolkit - Service Framework Service Registry

To support and aid developers utilising the [Service Framework](https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitycollective.service-framework) built by the Reality Collective, this repository is here for both Reality Collective members and the larger community to publish Services for other developers to use.

## What's included?

The Reality Collective team will shortly publish some example services along side some instructional posts in how to build services.  We will likely add more over time.

## Requirements

- [RealityToolkit.Service-Framework](https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitycollective.service-framework)
- [Unity 2020.3 and above](https://unity.com/)

## Contributing Services

Any developer is able to submit a service to the registry and free to do so and help out other developers with their projects.

A few considerations to keep in mind:

* Try to keep services unique, or offer additions / enhancements to existing services that have already been contributed
* Make sure to fully comment your code and implementation. If possible blog about your service and show its use. (not mandatory)
* Include a ReadMe or other short document to highlight how best to use your service and what benefits it provides.
* Services should be self-contained and not require external dependencies in this repository

> If your service has specific dependencies such as embedded dll's or other UPM packages, consider using the Reality Collective Project template and create a separate package for it.

If required, we will look to publish this repository as a UPM package to OpenUPM for easier use.
